## üß† Key Highlights
- Used classification models to detect gene significance across different cancer stages  
- Identified IL1B as a key regulator in late-stage samples  
- Automated downstream workflows: protein-ligand docking, complex formation, and MD simulation  
- Reduced manual steps by 20% using Python automation  
- Results show promising early insights for drug screening
